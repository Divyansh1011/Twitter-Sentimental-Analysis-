Means testing based on a $50,000 income in 2019 is cruel. Most of us have lost the jobs we had in 2019! Austerity is not a good look for DEMs, who will make the 1st Trump stimulus more humane!

Unless you have good looks, a special talent, or connections, there's usually a lot more sacrifice and responsibility that goes into it. Plenty of high paying jobs available. But few willing to do them.       weyenberg7   \n",

Tell him to get a full time job or two part time jobs as long as it is enough to live on because your quitting &amp; staying home with your babies. When he says he can’t tell him fine - get out. When he says you can’t do this on your own tell him. - watch me  SharonY59920329   \n",
